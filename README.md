# Huffman-Coding-Algorithm


This is a C++ implementation of the **Huffman Coding Algorithm**, a well-known algorithm used for **lossless data compression**. The project demonstrates how to compress and decompress text efficiently using a binary tree structure. The goal of this project is to understand how Huffman Coding works and to implement it in C++.

##  Project Overview

The **Huffman Coding Algorithm** minimizes the size of data by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones. It uses a **binary tree** (Huffman Tree) to generate these codes. This project provides a detailed implementation of the algorithm from scratch, focusing on building the tree, generating the codes, and encoding/decoding the data.

##  Technologies Used

- **C++17** â€“ For implementing the algorithm and handling the core logic.
- **Binary Tree** â€“ The structure used to build the Huffman Tree.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** â€“ Utilizing `priority_queue` for efficient tree construction, `map` for character frequencies, and `vector` for managing the nodes.
- **File I/O** â€“ For reading input data and writing compressed data (optional feature).

##  How Huffman Coding Works

1. **Frequency Calculation:**  
   - First, the algorithm counts the frequency of each character in the input text.

2. **Huffman Tree Construction:**  
   - Using a **priority queue**, the algorithm builds a binary tree where each node represents a character and its frequency. The two least frequent characters are combined to form a new node, and this process continues until a single tree is formed.

3. **Binary Code Generation:**  
   - The tree is then traversed, assigning binary codes to each character. Left edges represent `0`, and right edges represent `1`. The binary code for each character is determined by the path from the root of the tree to the character node.

4. **Encoding:**  
   - The input text is encoded using the generated binary codes for each character.

5. **Decoding:**  
   - The encoded binary data can be decoded back to its original text by traversing the Huffman Tree using the binary codes.

##  Features

- **Huffman Tree Construction:**  
  Builds a binary tree from the frequencies of the input characters using a **min-heap** (priority queue).
  
- **Text Compression:**  
  Compresses input text into a binary format using the generated Huffman codes.

- **Text Decompression:**  
  Decodes the compressed binary data back into the original text using the Huffman Tree.

- **File I/O Support:**  
  Optionally supports reading from and writing to text files for both compression and decompression.
